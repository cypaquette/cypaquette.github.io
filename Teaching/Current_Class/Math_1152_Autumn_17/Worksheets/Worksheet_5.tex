\noindent \textbf{{\large Problem 1}}\\
Let $R$ be the region bounded by the curve $2^x$, the $x$-axis, the
$y$-axis, and the line $x = 1$. Find the volume of the solid obtained
by rotating $R$ around the $y$-axis using:
\indent \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item the shell method
\item the washer method
\end{enumerate}
Verify that your answers agree.

\noindent \textbf{{\large Problem 2}}\\
Let $R$ be the region bounded by the curve $\arctan(x)$, the $x$-axis,
the $y$-axis, and the line $x = 1$. Find the volume of the solid
obtained by rotating $R$ around $x = -1$. 

\newpage
\noindent \textbf{{\large Problem 3}}\\
Find a formula for the anti-derivative of damped harmonic motion
$e^{-kt} \sin(\omega t)$ where $k > 0$ and $\omega$ is the
frequency. \\\\
Hint: To do this, you have to perform integration by parts twice, each
time taking $v'(t) = e^{-kt}$. Then you have to do a little algebra at
the end to solve for the unknown anti-derivative.
